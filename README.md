Teckhacks 4.0 Project made by Harshpreet Singh, Harshit Behal and Harshit Singla

**Problem Statement**

* Bridge theory-practice gap in medical education via simulations, cases and collaboration for comprehensive, hands-on learning experiences.

**Solution:**

* **Virtual Patient Simulations:**
Develop virtual patient scenarios that allow users to interact with and diagnose simulated cases. Include a diverse range of cases covering various medical specialties, enabling learners to apply theoretical * knowledge in a practical, risk-free environment.

* **Interactive Anatomy Modules:**
Offer detailed interactive modules for anatomy learning. Utilizing 3D models, augmented reality (AR), or virtual reality (VR) to allow users to explore the human body, its systems, and structures. Include quizzes and assessments to reinforce understanding.

* **Case-Based Learning Modules:**
Create a repository of real-life case studies covering different medical conditions. Users can analyze symptoms, order tests, make diagnoses, and develop treatment plans, with the platform providing feedback and insights at each step.
